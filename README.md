## HPV & p16INK4a Expression in Penile Cancer
### Description
This dataset contains information on 59 patients with penile lesions, including penile intraepitheial neoplasia (PeIN) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples were used to build 2 tissue microarrays (TMA). Clinicopathologic and outcome information was obtained from medical records. 

### Aim
The aim of this project is to evaluate human papillomavirus (HPV) status and p16INK4a immunohistochemical expression, accessing the relationship between HPV and p16INK4a and clinicopathologic and outcome features, and building prognostic models of penile cancer recurrence, progression, and outcome.

### Endpoints
This dataset considers the following as endpoints:
* Tumor recurrence
* Tumor progression
* Overall mortality
* Cancer-related mortality

### Researchers
* George J. Netto, M.D. - Principal investigator
* Stephania Bezerra, M.D. - Research fellow (data gathering)
